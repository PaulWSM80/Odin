# The Odin Project - Foundations: Variables and Operators

## Introduction

A short task to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript as specified in the JavaScript Foundations - Variables and Operators
[assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-variables-and-operators#assignment).

The task demonstrates logging console output, simple arithmetic expressions as well as variable and constant declarations.

## Assignment

1. Add 2 numbers together
2. Add a sequence of 6 different numbers together.
3. Print the value of the following expression: `(4 + 6 + 9) / 77` <!-- Answer should be approximately 0.24675 -->
4. Follow the instructions to use variables:
    * Type this statement at the top of the script tag: `let a = 10`
    * In the console `console.log(a)` should print `10`
    * Try the following in the console: `9 * a`
    * and this: `let b = 7 * a` (returns `undefined` *) and then `console.log(b)`
5. Now this sequence:
    * Declare a constant variable `MAX` with the value `57`
    * Set another variable `actual` to `MAX - 13`
    * Set another variable `percentage` to `actual / MAX`
    * If you type `percentage` in the console and press Enter you should see a value like `0.7719`
