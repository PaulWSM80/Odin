# The Odin Project - Foundations: CSS Flex

## Introduction

A short task to practice working with flex as specified in the CSS Foundations - Alignment
[assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment#assignment).

The task demonstrates the various features when using flex.

## Assignment

Go to the [CSS exercises repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) and complete the following
exercises:

### 01-flex-center

Working with the provided files use flexbox to center the div.


#### Desired Result

### 02-flex-header-1

Working with the provided files use flexbox rules to create a common webpage header style that scales with the screen.

The specification is as follows:

- There is space between all items and the edge of the header (specific px amount doesn't matter here).
- Logo is centred vertically and horizontally.
- list-items are horizontal, and are centred vertically inside the header.
- left-links and right-links are pushed all the way to the left and right, and stay at the edge of the header when the page is resized.
- Your solution does not use floats, inline-block, or absolute positioning.
- Note: For this exercise, it's completely acceptable to not match the font-family.

#### Desired Result

##### NARROW:

##### WIDE:

> [!NOTE]
> If the wide example appears to be shorter than the narrow example it has been scaled to fit the page. Both images are the same height at 100% scale.

### 03-flex-header-2

Working with the provided files use flexbox rules to create a common webpage header style that scales with the screen. For this exercise edits may be applied to both files.

The specification is as follows:

- Everything is centred vertically inside the header.
- There is 8px space between everything and the edge of the header.
- Items are arranged horizontally as seen in the outcome image.
- There is 16px between each item on both sides of the header.
- flex is used to arrange everything.

#### Desired Result

##### STATIC FULL:

> [!NOTE]
> The desired result has an rounded bottom left corner that is out of keeping with the internal style. This feature is not part of the exercise.

### 07-flex-layout-2

The specification is as follows:

- The header text is size 32px and weight 900.
- The header text is vertically centred and 16px from the edge of the screen.
- The footer is pushed to the bottom of the screen (the footer may go below the bottom of the screen if the content of the 'cards' section overflows- and/or if your screen is shorter).

- The sidebar and cards take up all available space above the footer.
- The sidebar is 300px wide (and it doesn't shrink).
- The sidebar links are size 24px, are white, and do not have the underline text decoration.

> [!NOTE]
> 1. The desired results have rounded bottom left corners that are out of keeping with the internal style. This feature is not part of the exercise.
